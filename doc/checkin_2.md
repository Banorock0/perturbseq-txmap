# Check-In 2
## Addressing Prior Feedback
- How will you test and document tests in this repo about the rewritting of PerturbSeq?
- The original PerturbSeq documentation contains ipynb notebooks with sample usage of the package. Additionally, there is a separate repo that is self-contained and has all the data required for a perturbseq demo, which we think is the best initial test: https://github.com/thomasmaxwellnorman/perturbseq_demo (i.e., we will write the perturbseq_demo Python notebook into an R notebook and test to see if the demo can be recreated)
